# React, the safe way

This course aims to introduce you to React, using Typescript.

The general approach consists in:

- focus on the minimal set of features to build an app,
- focus on how to use typing and how to organise the code to make
  a reliable, robust and easy to change application.

Non goals are:

- teach how to design your component, mostly because we don't have time for this!
- teach a huge number of libraries or knowing all the React API: all the React
  ecosystem is moving really fast (probably the versions I used when starting
  writing the course will be obsolete when I'll finish!), so we focus on things
  you can rely on in the long term. All the decent libraries have a doc
  explaining how to use them.

The course is organized in several lessons. Read the `README.md` file
in each lesson which contains instructions on what to do.

Feel free to open issues and/or pull requests to improve the course (especially
if you find typos).
